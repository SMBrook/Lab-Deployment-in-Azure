# Lab Deployment in Azure

Within this repo you will find an ARM template that deploys a virtual machine within Azure and then helps you build out a small lab environment within that virtual machine that can be used to replicate an on-prem solution you can use to set up Azure Backup, Azure Site Recovery, Azure Migrate, etc.

## Setup

The ARM template will deploy a virtual machine within Azure and then install Hyper-V within that virtual machine.  It will also download some VHD files and deploy three servers onto that Hyper-V environment. 

Once the servers are deployed you need to carry out the following configuration within the servers manually: 

- Log into AD01 and set the server to have a static IP configuration as follows: 
    - IP Address: 192.168.2.10
    - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
    - Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1
    - Preferred DNS: 127.0.0.1
    - Alternative DNS: 1.1.1.1

- Log into FS01 and set the server to have a static IP configuration as follows:
    - IP Address: 192.168.2.11
    - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
    - Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1
    - Preferred DNS: 192.168.2.10
    - Alternative DNS: 1.1.1.1

- Log into SQL01 and set the server to have a static IP configuration as follows:
    - IP Address: 192.168.2.13
    - Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0
    - Default Gateway: 192.168.2.1
    - Preferred DNS: 192.168.2.10
    - Alternative DNS: 1.1.1.1

- Within WEB01 run the following commands:
    - sudo apt-get update
    - sudo apt-get upgrade  
    - sudo apt-get install "linux-cloud-tools-$(uname -r)" -y
    - sudo apt-get install --install-recommends linux-tools-virtual-lts-xenial linux-cloud-tools-virtual-lts-xenial -y 

Once deployed the credentials for the servers are: 

**Username**: mcwadmin
**Password**: demo@pass123
